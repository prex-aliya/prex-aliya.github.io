WARNING: Under Construction<br>

</p>
<p>WIKI X WIKI, is a website where you can learn how to learn, and find where you
can learn, it will be a database of places to learn, and get off your feet.
Hopefully in the future, help become an expert in a specific field, or fields.</p>
<p>My goal for the back end of this website will be html with css, but without any
JavaScript, or cookies, or any client side scripting, and try to be compatible
with some heavy privacy settings. Dark mode is default, if enough want light
mode then, I consider adding such, as a custom secondary website, but that would
be hard to maintain as current.</p>
<p>Moved meat to <a href="">separate repository</a>, if wanted to use separately. The posts
will be available as markdown files, for now, for any to do as they please, you
could use <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook">mdbook</a>, or use
<a href="https://cobalt-org.github.io/">cobalt</a> to put up a mirror of this wiki, I will
do so myself.</p>
